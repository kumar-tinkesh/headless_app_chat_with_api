Intro to CarPlay and iPhone
Connect your iPhone to CarPlay to get turn-by-turn directions, make phone calls, listen to music, check your calendar, and more—all from your vehicle’s display.
Note: CarPlay isn’t available in all countries or regions (see the iOS and iPadOS Feature Availability website ).
CarPlay is available on select automobiles (see the CarPlay Available Models website ) and on select aftermarket navigation systems.
