Lock or hide an app on iPhone
If you want to show someone something on your iPhone but want peace of mind that they can’t get into certain apps, you can lock or hide the apps. Locking an app requires Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode to open it. Information inside a locked app won’t appear in other locations—for example, in CarPlay, notification previews, search, Siri suggestions, or your call history.
When you lock or hide an app on your device, it’s only locked or hidden on that device. The locked or hidden status of an app doesn’t sync with iCloud.
Note: Children under 13 in a Family Sharing group can’t lock or hide apps. Anyone aged 13 to 17 in a Family Sharing group can lock or hide an app, but a parent or guardian in the family group can see that the app was downloaded and how much time it’s used, and restrict access to it using Screen Time. (These ages vary by country or region.)
Lock an app
Locking an app requires Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode to open the app.

Go to the Home Screen .
Locate the app you want to lock.
Touch and hold the app icon until the quick actions menu opens.

You can unlock an app so you no longer need to use Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to open it.
Go to the Home Screen .

Touch and hold the app icon until the quick actions menu opens.

Hide an app
Hiding an app prevents others from seeing or opening it (unless they have a way to authenticate your iPhone using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode).
When you hide an app, its name is still visible in some places, such as Screen Time, Battery Usage By App (in Settings), and your App Store purchase history.
Note: Apps that come installed with iOS 18 or later can’t be hidden—only apps you download separately from the App Store can be hidden. Apps that are set by the user as default web browser or app marketplace (available only in the EU) can’t be hidden either.
Go to the Home Screen .

Touch and hold the app icon until the quick actions menu opens.
Tap Require Face ID (or Touch ID or Passcode).
