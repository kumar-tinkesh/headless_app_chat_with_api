Use hearing health features in Health on iPhone
In iOS 18.1, you can take a Hearing Test with your AirPods Pro 2 to provide insight into your hearing. Hearing Test results (audiograms) depict the results of a pure-tone audiometry test—they display how loud sounds need to be for you to hear them.
The difference between the decibel level you need and a normal level indicates your level of hearing loss. If there’s no difference, your hearing is normal. If there’s some or a lot of difference, your hearing is impaired.
Note: The Hearing Test is available for ages 18 and older. Not available in all countries or regions.
Take a Hearing Test
Go to the Health app on your iPhone.
Tap Browse, then tap Hearing.
Scroll down to Get More From Health, then tap Take Hearing Test.
Tap Get Started, then follow the onscreen instructions.
You can review the results from the Hearing Test in the Health app. You can also export a PDF version of your audiogram to share with your hearing healthcare professional.
