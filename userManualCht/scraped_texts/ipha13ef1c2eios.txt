Get directions to your parked car in Maps on iPhone
When you disconnect your iPhone from your car’s CarPlay or Bluetooth ® system and exit your vehicle, a parked car marker is dropped so you can easily find the way back to your car.
Find your parked car
Go to the Maps app on your iPhone.
Choose Parked Car below Siri Suggestions.
If you don’t find your parked car in Maps
Make sure your iPhone is paired to CarPlay or Bluetooth in your car, then make sure of the following settings:
Location Services is turned on in Settings > Privacy & Security.
Significant Locations is turned on in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services.
Show Parked Location is turned on in Settings > Apps > Maps.
Note: Your parked car isn’t marked at a location where you frequently park, like at home or work.
Don’t show your parked location
Go to the Maps app on your iPhone.
To remove the Parked Car marker for your car’s current location, touch and hold the marker, then tap Remove Car.
To never show your parked location, go to Settings > Apps > Maps, then turn off Show Parked Location.
