Use iPhone as a remote microphone with Live Listen
You can stream sound from the microphone on iPhone to your MFi hearing devices or AirPods. This can help you hear better in some situations—for example, when having a conversation in a noisy environment.
If you’re using AirPods, place them in your ears.
If your AirPods don’t automatically connect to iPhone, tap in Control Center or on the Lock Screen, then choose your AirPods.
To turn Live Listen on or off, do one of the following:
Open Control Center , tap , tap your hearing device or AirPods, then tap Live Listen.
(If you don’t see , add it to Control Center—go to Settings > Control Center, then tap next to Hearing.)
If you’ve set up the Accessibility Shortcut , triple-click the side or Home button, tap Hearing Devices, then tap Live Listen.
If you’re using hearing aids, go to Settings > Accessibility > Hearing Devices, then turn on Live Listen.
Position iPhone near the sound source.
