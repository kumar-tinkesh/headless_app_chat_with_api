Get a summary of a phone call or audio recording on iPhone with Apple Intelligence
In the Phone app, you can record a phone call and then use Apple Intelligence* to generate a summary of the transcript, so you can get to the most important information at a glance. You can also use Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of audio you record in the Notes app—like a class lecture.
Note: Apple Intelligence is available in iOS 18.1 or later on all iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple Intelligence is not available on iPhone and iPad if you’re in the EU and if your Apple Account country or region is also in the EU. To check whether Apple Intelligence is available for your device and language, see the Apple Support article Apple Intelligence requirements .
