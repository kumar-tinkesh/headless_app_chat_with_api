Use other apps during a FaceTime call on iPhone
While you’re on a call using the FaceTime app , you can use other apps—for example, to look up information, write a note, or perform a calculation.
Go to the Home Screen , then tap an app icon to open the app.
To return to the FaceTime screen, tap the green bar (or the FaceTime icon) at the top of the screen.
You can also share your screen with the other people in your FaceTime call while using another app. See Share your screen in a FaceTime call .
