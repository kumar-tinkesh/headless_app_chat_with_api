Clear your location history in Maps on iPhone
The Maps app uses information about your significant locations from Location Services to provide you with personalized services like predictive traffic routing. Your significant locations are end-to-end encrypted and can’t be read by Apple. You can delete your significant locations at any time—for example, to reset predictive traffic routing and similar personalized services.
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security.
Tap Location Services, tap System Services, then tap Significant Locations.
Tap Clear History.
This action clears all your significant locations everywhere you’re signed in to the same Apple Account .
