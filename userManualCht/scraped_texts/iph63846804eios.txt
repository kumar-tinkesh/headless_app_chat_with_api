Import data from another browser into Safari on iPhone
In iOS 18.2 or later, you can import data into Safari that you’ve exported from another browser. Browser data can include bookmarks, history, extensions, credit cards, and passwords.
Go to Settings > Apps > Safari.
Below History and Website Data, tap Import.
Tap Choose File, then choose a file (or a .zip file of files) to import.
Individual files might be available for each piece of browsing data, such as bookmarks or history.
Tap Import to Safari.
You’ll see a description of the browser data you imported.
Note: Any passwords you import go into the Passwords app.
Tap Done.
WARNING: For security, delete the file or folder you imported. It may include unencrypted data and could be visible to anyone who can access it.
