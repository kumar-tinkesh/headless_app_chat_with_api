Connect iPhone to a display with a cable
With the appropriate cable or adapter, you can connect your iPhone to a secondary display, like a computer monitor, TV, or projector.
Depending on your iPhone model, plug a Lightning Digital AV Adapter, Lightning to VGA Adapter, USB-C Display AV Adapter, or USB-C VGA Multi-port Adapter into the charging port on the bottom of iPhone.
Connect an HDMI or VGA cable to the adapter.
Connect the other end of the HDMI or VGA cable to the monitor, TV, or projector.
If necessary, switch to the correct video source on the monitor, TV, or projector. If you need help, use the displayâ€™s manual.
The adapters have an extra port so you can connect the charging cable and charge your iPhone while connected to a monitor, TV, or projector.
