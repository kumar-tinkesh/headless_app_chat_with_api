Sync contacts across devices on iPhone
To keep your contact information up to date across all your devices where you’re signed in to your Apple Account , you can use iCloud.
Go to Settings > [ your name ] > iCloud.
Tap See All next to Saved to iCloud, then turn on Contacts.
Alternatively, you can sync the information between iPhone and your Mac or Windows device to keep the information up to date across iPhone and your computer. See Sync supported content .
If you use iCloud for Contacts, your contacts are kept up to date automatically, and no options appear for syncing them with your computer.
