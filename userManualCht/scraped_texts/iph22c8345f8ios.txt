Adjust accessibility settings for the Camera Control on iPhone
On all iPhoneÂ 16 models, you can change the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control or the speed required to lightly double-press it. You can also change the gesture you use to access controls like Zoom or Depth, disable that gesture, or disable the Camera Control entirely.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Camera Control.
Do any of the following:
Disable the Camera Control entirely: Turn off Camera Control.
Use a light press gesture to access controls: Turn Light-Press on. Turn it off to disable the gesture.
Use a swipe gesture to access controls: Turn on Swipe. Turn it off to disable the gesture.
Adjust the pressure required to lightly press the Camera Control: Choose a firmness option below Light-Press Force. You can practice the gesture to try out the pressure you set.
Adjust the speed required to lightly double-press the Camera Control: Below Double Light-Press Speed, choose how fast you need to press for iPhone to recognize a light double press.
You can also customize the Camera Control to open the Magnifier app. See Use the Camera Control to open another app .
