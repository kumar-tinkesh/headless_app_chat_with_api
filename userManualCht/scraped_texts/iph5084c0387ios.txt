Use Quick Notes on iPhone
You can use Quick Notes to jot down information over any app or screen on iPhone. Add links, images, tags, and mentions to a Quick Note so you can get to important names, numbers, and ideas easily. When you highlight text in Safari or add a link from an app, you see a Quick Note thumbnail next time you visit the site, taking you right to what you were viewing before.
You can access all your Quick Notes in the Notes app. And when you make a Quick Note on your iPhone, you can see the note on your iPad and Mac, too.
