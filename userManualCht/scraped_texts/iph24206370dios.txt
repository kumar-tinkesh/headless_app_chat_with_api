Dictate text while using Magic Keyboard with iPhone
You can dictate text instead of typing it on Magic Keyboard.
Note: Dictation may not be available in all languages or in all countries or regions, and features may vary. Cellular data charges may apply.
Go to Settings > General > Keyboard, turn on Enable Dictation, then choose a dictation shortcut.
To insert text by dictating, tap to place the insertion point, then press the dictation shortcut key twice.
To use Magic Keyboard again, quickly press the dictation shortcut key twice.
As you speak to insert text, iPhone automatically inserts punctuation for you. You can insert emoji by saying their names (for example, “mind blown emoji” or “happy emoji”).
