Quit and reopen an app on iPhone
If an app isn’t responding, you can quit it and then reopen it to try and resolve the issue. (Typically, there’s no reason to quit an app; quitting it doesn’t save battery power, for example.)
To quit the app, open the App Switcher , swipe right to find the app, then swipe up on the app.
To reopen the app, go to the Home Screen (or App Library ), then tap the app.
If quitting and reopening the app doesn’t resolve the issue, try restarting iPhone.
