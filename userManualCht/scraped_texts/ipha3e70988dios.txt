Set up call waiting on iPhone
You can set up call waiting on iPhone if you have cellular service through a GSM network.
If you have cellular service through a CDMA network, contact your carrier for information about setting up call waiting.
Go to Settings > Apps > Phone.
Tap Call Waiting, then turn on Call Waiting.
If you’re on a call and call waiting is turned off, incoming calls go directly to voicemail.
On models with Dual SIM, call waiting works only for incoming calls on the same line, unless the other line has Wi-Fi Calling turned on and a data connection is available. See Set up cellular service on iPhone .
