Make a Group FaceTime call on iPhone
In the FaceTime app , you can talk with up to 32 participants in a Group FaceTime call (not available in all countries or regions).
Start a Group FaceTime call
In FaceTime, tap New FaceTime near the top of the screen.
Type the names or numbers of the people you want to call in the entry field at the top.
You can also tap to open Contacts and add people from there. Or tap suggested contacts.
Tap to make a video call or tap to make a FaceTime audio call.
Each participant appears in a tile on the screen. When a participant speaks (verbally or by using sign language) or you tap the tile, that tile becomes highlighted or more prominent. Tiles that can’t fit on the screen appear in a row at the bottom. To find a participant you don’t see, swipe through the row. (The participant’s initials may appear in the tile if an image isn’t available.)
Note: To see participants’ images arranged in a grid, see View participants in a grid layout in FaceTime on iPhone .
To prevent the tile of the person speaking or signing from becoming more prominent during a Group FaceTime call, go to Settings > Apps > FaceTime, then turn off Speaking below Automatic Prominence.
Note: Sign language detection requires a supported model for the presenter. In addition, both the presenter and participants need iOS 14, iPadOS 14, macOS 11, or later.
