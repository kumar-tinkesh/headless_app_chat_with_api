Share Apple Podcasts subscriptions
When you subscribe to podcast channels, you can use Family Sharing to share your subscriptions with up to five other family members. Your family group members will automatically have access to the channels you subscribe to.
If you join a family group and a family group member subscribes to a show you already subscribe to, your subscription isn’t renewed on your next billing date; instead, you use the group’s subscription. If you join a family group that doesn’t subscribe, the group uses your subscription.
Note: To stop sharing a show subscription with a family group, you can cancel the subscription or leave a Family Sharing group .
