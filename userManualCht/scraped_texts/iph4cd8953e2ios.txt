Share App Store, Apple TV, and Apple Books purchases with Family Sharing on iPhone
With Family Sharing , the organizer can set up purchase sharing to share App Store, Apple Books, and Apple TV purchases.
The organizer adds a payment method that’s shared with the family; when a family member makes a purchase, the organizer is billed. The purchased item is added to the initiating family member’s account and eligible purchases are shared with the rest of the family.
The family organizer can also require that children in the family group request approval for purchases or free downloads. See Set up parental controls with Family Sharing .
Turn on purchase sharing
When the family organizer turns on purchase sharing, they pay for family members’ purchases and must have a valid payment method on file.
Go to Settings > Family.
Tap Purchase Sharing, then follow the onscreen instructions.
