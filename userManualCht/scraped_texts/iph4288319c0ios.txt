Pair Magic Keyboard with iPhone
You can use Magic Keyboard, including Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, to enter text on iPhone. Magic Keyboard connects to iPhone using Bluetooth®.
Pair Magic Keyboard
Make sure the keyboard is turned on and charged.
On iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth, then turn on Bluetooth.
Select the device when it appears in the Other Devices list.
Note: If Magic Keyboard is already paired with another device, you must unpair them before you can connect Magic Keyboard to your iPhone. Do one of the following:
On iPhone or iPad: See Unpair a Bluetooth accessory .
On macOS 13 or later: Choose Apple menu > System Settings, click Bluetooth in the sidebar, Control-click the device, then choose Forget.

Reconnect Magic Keyboard to iPhone
Magic Keyboard disconnects when you turn its switch to Off or when you move it or iPhone out of Bluetooth range—about 33 feet (10 meters).
To reconnect, turn the keyboard switch to On, or bring the keyboard and iPhone back into range, then tap any key.
