Choose iPhone settings for travel
When you travel with iPhone, choose settings that comply with airline requirements. Some airlines let you keep your iPhone turned on if you switch to Airplane Mode. By default, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® are disabled in Airplane Mode—you can’t make calls, but you can listen to music, play games, watch videos, and use other apps that don’t require network or phone connections.
