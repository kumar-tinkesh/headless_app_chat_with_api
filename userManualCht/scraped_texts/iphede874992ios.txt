You can have your iPhone (or your family member’s iPhone) check for sensitive images and warn you before you view them.
Turn on Sensitive Content Warning
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security.
Scroll down and tap Sensitive Content Warning, then turn on Sensitive Content Warning.
You (or your family member) will receive a warning before receiving or sending sensitive images.
Note: Sensitive Content Warning is turned on automatically if you set up Screen Time and turn on Communication Safety. See Check for sensitive images on iPhone .
In Screen Time, you can also block inappropriate content and set restrictions on purchases. See Block content and prevent iTunes & App Store purchases .
