Create custom gestures
You can add gestures you use often (such as touch and hold or two-finger rotation) to the AssistiveTouch menu. You can even create several gestures with, for example, different degrees of rotation.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch > Create New Gesture.
Perform your gesture on the recording screen. For example:
Touch-and-hold gesture: Touch and hold your finger in one spot until the recording progress bar reaches halfway, then lift your finger. Be careful not to move your finger while recording, or the gesture will be recorded as a drag.
Two-finger rotation gesture: Rotate two fingers on the iPhone screen around a point between them. (You can do this with a single finger or stylus—just create each arc separately, one after the other.)
If you record a sequence of taps or drag gestures, they’re all played back at the same time. For example, using one finger or a stylus to record four separate, sequential taps at four locations on the screen creates a simultaneous four-finger tap.
If your gesture doesn’t turn out quite right, tap Cancel, then try again.
When you’re satisfied with your gesture, tap Save, then name the gesture.
To use your custom gesture, tap the AssistiveTouch menu button , tap Custom, then choose the gesture. When the blue circles representing your gesture appear, drag them to where you want to use the gesture, then release.
