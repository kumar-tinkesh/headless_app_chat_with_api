Change settings in CarPlay
In Settings in CarPlay, you can change the Wallpaper, turn on Driving Focus, change how CarPlay looks on the display, turn suggestions in CarPlay Dashboard on or off, and show or hide album art.
Use the Driving Focus with CarPlay
The Driving Focus helps you stay focused on the road. While your iPhone is connected to CarPlay and Driving Focus is on, notifications and text messages are silenced or limited.
Open Settings in CarPlay using your vehicle’s built-in controls.
Note: If you’re viewing CarPlay Dashboard and Settings doesn’t appear in the recent apps list on the left, tap to see pages of all of your CarPlay apps, including Settings.
Go to Driving Focus, then select Activate With CarPlay.
If you receive a Driving Focus notification when you’re not driving (for example, when you’re a passenger) you can turn it off—tap the notification, then tap “I’m not driving.”

CarPlay is set to dark appearance by default in most vehicles. If you prefer to have CarPlay automatically switch between dark and light appearance, do the following:
