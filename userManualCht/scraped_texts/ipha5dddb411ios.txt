Get started with Fitness on iPhone
Use the Fitness app on iPhone to help you meet your fitness goals. You can track your progress, view completed workouts, change your goals, and share your activity with others.
See your summary
Open the Fitness app to see a summary of your Activity rings, the number of steps you’ve taken, distance traveled, trends, and more. You can also customize the Summary tab to include the metrics that you want to see. Tap the Summary tab, scroll down to the bottom of the screen, then tap Edit Summary.
Change your goals
You can change your daily goals for each of your Activity rings. You can also customize your Activity ring goals by the day of the week. In the Summary tab, tap the Activity rings, scroll down, then tap Change Goals.
Pause your rings
If you need to take a break, you can pause your Activity rings for a day, week, month, or more—without breaking your award streak. You can pause your rings for up to 90 days and resume at any time. Tap the Summary tab, tap the Activity rings, scroll down, then tap Pause Rings.
Share your activity with friends
