Send files from the Files app on iPhone
You can send a copy of any file to others. If you have a document you want to send that isn’t digitized, you can scan it with the Files app first.
Send a file
Go to the Files app on your iPhone.
Touch and hold the file you want to send, then tap Share.
Tip: To send a smaller version of the file, tap Compress before you tap Share, touch and hold the compressed version of the file (identified as a zip file), then tap Share.
Choose an option for sending (for example, AirDrop, Messages, or Mail), then tap Send.
Reply to a received document
If you save an attachment from the Mail app, you can quickly reply to the email and optionally return the attachment.
Go to the Files app on your iPhone.
Touch and hold the file you want to reply to, then tap “Reply to.”
Scan a document
Go to the Files app on your iPhone.
Open the location or folder where the document you want to scan is located.
Tap at the top of the screen, then tap Scan Documents.
Tip: If the files or folders you want to share are stored in iCloud Drive, you can invite others to view or edit their contents—you don’t need to send them copies.
