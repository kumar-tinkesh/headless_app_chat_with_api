Follow teams with My Sports in the Apple TV app on iPhone
You can add your favorite teams to My Sports to see their games in Continue Watching and receive notifications when they’re about to play.
When you turn on syncing for My Sports, the teams you follow in Apple TV are automatically followed in Apple News, Apple Sports, and other supported apps. If you already set up My Sports in the News app, the teams you follow appear in the Apple TV app.
If you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac signed in to the same Apple Account , you can also see the teams you’re following with My Sports in the Apple TV app and in the News app on those devices.
Note: My Sports isn’t available in all countries or regions.
