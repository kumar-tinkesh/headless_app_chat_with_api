Apply consistent styles and formatting in Freeform on iPhone
When you want the text in your sticky notes, shapes, or text boxes to have a consistent look in Freeform—for example, font, size, and color—you can copy the style from one item and paste it in another. You can also save styles.
Go to the Freeform app on your iPhone.
Tap an item on a board and make any adjustments to the formatting—so it has the style you want to copy.
When you have an item that’s formatted in a style you like, tap it to show its formatting tools.
Tap , tap Style, then tap Copy Style.
Tap to select and show the formatting tools for an item whose style you want to change.
Tap , tap Style, then tap Paste Style.
Depending on the item you’re pasting a style into, fonts, line weight, or color are matched.
For linked or placed files, pasted styles update corners and shadows.
Tip: If you like the style of an item, you can save its style. Then, every time you add another item like that to your board, it uses that saved style. Tap , tap Style, then choose Save as Insert Style.
