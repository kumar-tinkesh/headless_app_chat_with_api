Control access to information in apps on iPhone
You control whether third-party apps have access to information in Contacts, Photos, Calendar, and other apps.
Review or change access to information in apps
The first time an app wants to use information from another app, you receive a request with an explanation. For example, a messaging app may request access to your contacts to find friends who are using the same app. After you grant or deny access, you can change access later.
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security.
Tap a category of information, such as Calendars, Reminders, or Motion & Fitness.
A list appears showing the apps that requested access. You can turn access on or off for any app on the list.
Review how apps are using the permissions you grant them
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security, then tap App Privacy Report.
The App Privacy Report shows you how apps are using the permissions you granted them and shows you their network activity.
To turn off the report and delete its data, go to Settings > Privacy & SecurityÂ > App Privacy Report, then tap Turn Off App Privacy Report. You can return to this Settings screen to turn the report on again.
