Recognize sounds using iPhone
Your iPhone can continuously listen for certain sounds—such as a doorbell, siren, or crying baby—and notify you when it recognizes these sounds.
Note: Don’t rely on your iPhone to recognize sounds in circumstances where you may be harmed or injured, in high-risk or emergency situations, or for navigation.
Set up Sound Recognition
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Sound Recognition, then turn on Sound Recognition.
Tap Sounds, then turn on the sounds you want iPhone to recognize.
Tip: To quickly turn Sound Recognition on or off, add it to Control Center .
Add a custom alarm, appliance, or doorbell
You can also set up iPhone to recognize a custom alarm, appliance, or doorbell if they aren’t recognized automatically.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Sound Recognition > Sounds.
Tap Custom Alarm or Custom Appliance or Doorbell, then enter a name.
When your alarm, appliance, or doorbell is ready, place iPhone near the sound and minimize background noise.
Tap Start Listening, then follow the onscreen instructions.
