View and save measurements on iPhone
On supported models , you can save a list of all the measurements you take in a single session, complete with screenshots, so you can easily share and access them whenever you need them.
Go to the Measure app (in the Utilities folder) on your iPhone.
Tap to see a list of your recent measurements.
Swipe up from the top of the list to see more measurements.
To save the measurements, tap Copy, open another app (for example, Notes), tap in a document, then tap Paste.
Note: Height measurements aren’t included in this list. To save a person’s height measurement, see Measure a person’s height .
