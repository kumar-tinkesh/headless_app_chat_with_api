Harden your iPhone from a cyberattack with Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode is an extreme protection feature for iPhone. Its protections include safer wireless connectivity defaults, media handling, media sharing defaults, sandboxing, and network security optimizations.
Lockdown Mode is optional and should be used only if you believe you might be targeted by a highly sophisticated cyberattack, such as by a private company developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware.
Important: Most people are never targeted by attacks of this nature.
When iPhone is in Lockdown Mode, it doesn’t function as it typically does. Apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security, and some functionality isn’t available, including:
SharePlay
Shared Albums
FaceTime Live Photos
FaceTime Continuity Handoff
In addition, your iPhone must be unlocked to connect with wired accessories. (Some connections are permitted for a short time after going into Lockdown Mode.)
Turn on Lockdown Mode
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode, then tap Turn On Lockdown Mode.
If you’ve set up an Apple Watch with your iPhone, turning on Lockdown Mode also turns it on for the paired Apple Watch (requires watchOS 10 or later).
Important: For complete protection, all of your devices must have Lockdown Mode turned on.
