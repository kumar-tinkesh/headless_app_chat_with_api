Share your data in Health on iPhone
You can share health data stored in the Health app—such as health alerts and trends—with friends, family, and others caring for you.
Share health data with a loved one
People you share health data with can also view the health notifications you receive, including high heart rate and irregular rhythm notifications. You can also share notifications for significant trends, such as a steep decline in activity.
Note: To share health data with someone, you need to include them in your contacts .
Go to the Health app on your iPhone.

You receive a notification when your invitation is accepted.
Share health data with your doctor

Share health and fitness data with apps and devices
You can give other apps permission to share health and fitness data with Health. For example, if you install a workout app, its exercise data can appear in Health. The workout app can also read and make use of data (such as your heart rate and weight) shared by other devices and apps. If you didn’t give an app permission to share data with Health when you set up the app, you can give permission later. You can also remove permission from an app.
