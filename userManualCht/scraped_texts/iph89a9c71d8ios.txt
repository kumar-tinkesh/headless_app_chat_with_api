Edit contacts on iPhone
Assign a photo to a contact, add a pronunciation and pronouns, change a label, add a birthday, and more.
Go to the Contacts app on your iPhone.
Tap a contact, then tap Edit.
Enter or update the contact’s information.
When you’re finished, tap Done.
On models with Dual SIM , when you call or text a contact, iPhone uses the same line you used for your previous communication with this contact by default. To choose a preferred line for phone calls and SMS/MMS message conversations, select the contact, tap default (below the contact’s name), then choose a line.
To change how your contacts are sorted and displayed, go to Settings > Apps > Contacts.
