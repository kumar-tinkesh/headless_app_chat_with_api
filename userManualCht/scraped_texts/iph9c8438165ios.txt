Announce incoming text messages with CarPlay
Use CarPlay to have Siri automatically read your incoming text messages and listen for your response.
On your iPhone, go to Settings > Siri Â > Announce Notifications, then turn on Announce Notifications.
Note: You can also enable or disable Announce Messages directly in CarPlay by tapping Announce when Siri reads an incoming text message. See Have Siri announce notifications .
