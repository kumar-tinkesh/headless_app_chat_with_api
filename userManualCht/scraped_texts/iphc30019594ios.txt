Download health records on iPhone
The Health app offers secure access to information about your vaccinations, allergies, conditions, medications, and more (not available in all countries or regions).
You can use a QR code or a link from a healthcare provider or authority to download a test result record, and you can set up automatic downloads for a range of health records from supporting healthcare organizations.
Note: When iPhone is locked with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, all of the health data in the Health app—other than what you add to your Medical ID —is encrypted.
Set up automatic health record downloads from your healthcare provider
Supporting healthcare organizations can securely and automatically download records of your allergies, medical conditions, medications, labs, vaccinations, and more to Health.
Go to the Health app on your iPhone.
Tap your picture or initials at the top right.
If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom of the screen, then scroll to the top of the screen.
Tap Health Records, then do one of the following:
Set up your first download: Tap Get Started.
Set up downloads for additional accounts: Tap Add Account.
A list of nearby organizations appears. If your organization doesn’t appear in the list, enter the name of a clinic, hospital, or other place where you obtain health records. Or enter the name of a city, state, or province to find organizations near there.
Tap the name of your organization.
Tap Connect Account (below Available to Connect) to go to the sign-in screen for your patient portal.
Enter the user name and password you use for the patient web portal of that organization, then follow the onscreen instructions.
After you set up downloads from an organization, you automatically receive new records in Health as they become available.
Note: Your healthcare organization might not appear in this feature. Organizations are added frequently.
