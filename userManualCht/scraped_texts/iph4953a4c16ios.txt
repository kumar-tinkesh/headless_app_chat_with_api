Find music shared with you on iPhone
When a friend shares music with you in the Messages app , you can easily find it in Shared with You in the Music app.
Note: Music must be turned on in Settings > Apps > Messages > Shared with You, and your friend must be in your contacts list in Contacts.
Go to the Music app on your iPhone.
Tap Home, swipe up to Shared with You, then do any of the following:
Tap a song to listen to it.
Tap the name of the person, people, or group that shared the song to reply to them using Messages.
Touch and hold the song to take other actions—for example, add it to your library, create a station, reply to the sender, or remove it.
