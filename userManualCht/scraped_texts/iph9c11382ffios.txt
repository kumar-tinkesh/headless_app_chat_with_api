Solve crossword and crossword mini puzzles in News on iPhone
Apple News+ offers subscribers a new crossword and crossword mini puzzle every day. Crossword puzzles start out easy but get increasingly challenging as the week goes on. When you want a puzzle you can solve in next to no time, try an always-easy crossword mini puzzle.
You can navigate and solve crossword and crossword mini puzzles in multiple ways. For example, you can display puzzles in the traditional grid view, or instead choose to show clues and answers in a list. You can tap squares to select words, or hide the keyboard and choose clues from a list.
You don’t have to solve puzzles all at once; you can return at any time. The timer pauses while you’re away.
Note: Apple News, Apple News+, and puzzles aren’t available in all countries or regions. See the iOS and iPadOS Feature Availability website .
