Use iPhone to allow calls and text messages on your iPad and Mac
You can relay phone calls and text messages through your iPhone to your iPad or Mac, so it’s easy to stay in touch no matter what device you’re on.
Use your iPhone to make and receive phone calls or messages on your iPad, Mac, or another iPhone.
Note: Cellular charges may apply. Wi-Fi Calling isn’t available from all carriers.
Before you begin
Make sure of the following:
Both devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ® turned on.
You’re signed in to the same Apple Account on both devices.
FaceTime is set up on your iPhone, as well as the other device that you want to use for calls or text messages. See Get started with FaceTime on iPhone , Get started with FaceTime on iPad ,  and Sign in to or out of FaceTime on Mac .
If you’re using a VPN, make sure its configuration does not prevent local networking as that may interfere with some Continuity features.
Set up your iPhone to allow phone calls on your other devices
Go to Settings > Cellular.
Note: If your iPhone has Dual SIMs, choose a line (below SIMs).
Do any of the following:
Tap Calls on Other Devices, turn on Allow Calls on Other Devices, then choose the devices you want to allow to make and receive calls.
The devices you choose can make and receive calls when they’re near your iPhone, connected to Wi-Fi, and signed in to the same Apple Account.
Tap Wi-Fi Calling, turn on Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone, then turn on Add Wi-Fi Calling For Other Devices.
Other devices can make and receive calls over Wi-Fi, even when they’re not near your iPhone, as long as they’re signed in to the same Apple Account.
On your other devices, do the following:
On your iPad or another iPhone: Go to Settings > Apps > FaceTime, then turn on Allow Calls on Other Devices.
On your Mac: Open FaceTime, choose FaceTime > Settings, then select Calls from iPhone. If an Upgrade to Wi-Fi Calling button appears, click it, then follow the instructions.
Note: If you turn on Wi-Fi Calling, emergency calls can be made over Wi-Fi, and your device’s location information can be used for emergency calls to aid response efforts, regardless of whether you enable Location Services. Some carriers might use the address you registered with the carrier when signing up for Wi-Fi Calling as your location.
Make or receive phone calls on your iPad or Mac
After you set up your iPhone to allow calls on your other devices, you can make and receive phone calls on your iPad and Mac.
Make a call: On your iPad or Mac, tap or click a phone number in Contacts, Calendar, FaceTime, Messages, Search, or Safari. Or open FaceTime, tap or click New FaceTime, then enter a contact or phone number.
