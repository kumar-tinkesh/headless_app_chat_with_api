Measure a person’s height with iPhone
On supported models , you can instantly measure a person’s height from the floor to the top of their head, hair, or hat. (You can even measure a person’s seated height.)
Go to the Measure app (in the Utilities folder) on your iPhone.
Position iPhone so that the person you want to measure appears on the screen from head to toe.
After a moment, a line appears at the top of the person’s head (or hair, or hat), with the height measurement showing just below the line.
To take a photo of the measurement, tap .
To save the photo, tap the screenshot in the lower-left corner, tap Done, then choose Save to Photos or Save to Files.
You can easily access and share the height measurement image from Photos or Files on iPhone whenever you want.
To take the measurement again, turn iPhone away for a moment to reset the height.
