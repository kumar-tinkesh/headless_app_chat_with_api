Create and use scenes in Home on iPhone
In the Home app, you can create scenes that allow you to control multiple accessories at once. For example, you might define a “Reading” scene that adjusts the lights, plays soft music on HomePod, closes the drapes, and adjusts the thermostat.
Create a scene
Go to the Home app on your iPhone.
On the Home tab, tap , then tap Add Scene.
Tap Custom, enter a name for the scene (such as “Dinner Party” or “Watching TV”), then tap Add Accessories.
Select the accessories you want this scene to include, then tap Done.
The first accessory you select determines the room the scene is assigned to. If you first select your bedroom lamp, for example, the scene is assigned to your bedroom.
Set each accessory to the state you want it in when you run the scene.
For example, for a Reading scene, you could set the bedroom lights to 100 percent, choose a low volume for the HomePod, and set the thermostat to 68 degrees.
Test the scene and choose whether or not to show it on the Home tab (scenes appear on the Home tab by default), then tap Done.
