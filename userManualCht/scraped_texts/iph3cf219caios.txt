Get music on iPhone
Enjoy music stored on iPhone as well as music streamed over the internet. You can build a music library—your collection of songs and albums—in many ways.
Subscribe to Apple Music
When you subscribe to Apple Music , you can start listening to millions of songs from the Apple Music catalog right away. To access your music library on all your devices, turn on Sync Library (go to Settings > Apps > Music). Then, add and download songs so that you can play your favorites any time, even when you’re offline.
Tip: Purchase an Apple Music family subscription, and everyone in your Family Sharing group can share an Apple Music subscription .
Buy music from the iTunes Store
If you don’t subscribe to Apple Music and you want to add your favorite songs or albums, you can buy and download music from the iTunes Store. And, if you previously purchased items from the iTunes Store, you can download them to your authorized computers and devices (up to 10 total).
Transfer music from your Mac or Windows device
Connect your Mac or Windows device to transfer and update music between your iPhone and your device. To sync supported content , use Music (macOS 10.15 or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 or earlier and Windows devices).
Note: Services and features aren’t available in all countries or regions, and features may vary by region. Additional charges may apply when using a cellular connection.
