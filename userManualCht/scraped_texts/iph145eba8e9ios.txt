When you use iPhone with one hand in portrait orientation, you can use Reachability to lower the top half of the screen so it’s within easy reach of your thumb.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then turn on Reachability.
To lower the top half of the screen, do one the following:
On an iPhone with Face ID: Swipe down on the bottom edge of the screen.
On an iPhone with a Home button: Lightly double-tap the Home button.
To return to the full screen, tap the upper half of the screen.
