Unlock your door with a home key on iPhone or Apple Watch
Some maker’s locks provide the ability to unlock your door with an access code, with home key in Apple Wallet (on your compatible iPhone and Apple Watch), or both.
While pairing a supported lock in the Home app, a home key is automatically added to Apple Wallet on your iPhone.
Note: The Home app supports both HomeKit and Matter-compatible locks.
Set up a home key
Go to the Home app on your iPhone.
Add a supported lock .
Choose an unlocking option.
Express Mode: Unlock the door without authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID.
Require Face ID or Passcode: Hold your device near the lock, then use Face ID or Touch ID to unlock it.
Choose automations such as Lock After Door Closes and Lock When Leaving Home.
If the lock works with a home key, all residents of your household receive the home key automatically.
Note: Not all Home app-compatible locks support home key.
Unlock your door with a home key
When you have a home key on your iPhone or Apple Watch and you’ve turned on Express Mode , place your device near the lock to unlock it. You can use the Home app to share access with other people.
Set up an access code for a guest
In the Home app you can set up an access code for people who need temporary access to your home.
Go to the Home app on your iPhone.
On the Home tab, touch and hold the lock, tap Accessory Settings, tap Manage Access, then tap Add Guest.
Give the guest a name—Dog Walker, for example—then turn on the locks you want them to have access to.
Tap Change Access Code, enter an access code, then tap Done.
Touch and hold the access code, tap Share, choose a sharing option, then share the access code with the guest.
You can return to this screen to change the access code, turn off access to some or all of the locks, or remove the guest.
Note: Not all Home app-compatible locks support access codes.
