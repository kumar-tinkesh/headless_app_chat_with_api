Collaborate on a document in FaceTime on iPhone
In a FaceTime call, you can collaborate on a shared document. You can initiate collaboration in a FaceTime call that’s in progress, or you can initiate collaboration from the app where the document was created.
Start a conversation in the FaceTime app with the people you want to collaborate with. (See Make a FaceTime call .)
Tap , then choose the app you want to use below Collaborate.
If you don’t see , tap the screen to open the FaceTime controls.
Open the document, then do one of the following:
Tap Collaborate in the notification that appears.
Tap , choose how to share the document (FaceTime, AirDrop, Mail, or Messages), then tap Collaborate.
Tap Start in the collaboration notification that appears at the top of your screen.
Participants get a notification that you’ve shared a document you want to collaborate on. When they tap Open in the notification, the document opens on their device.
Everyone who receives and opens the document can make changes and see changes made by others. When someone makes a change, a notification is sent to everyone who’s collaborating on the document.
