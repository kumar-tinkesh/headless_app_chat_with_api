Organize your notes with tags on iPhone
In the Notes app, you can use tags as a fast and flexible way to categorize and organize your notes. You can add one or more tags to a note, such as #shopping and #work, and easily search and filter your notes across folders using the Tag Browser or Smart Folders.
Add tags to notes
When you create or edit a note, type # followed by the tag name or choose a tag from the menu above the keyboard. A tag can only be one word, but you can use dashes and underscores to combine words. You can add multiple tags to a note.
Tip: You can use your finger to write a tag in a note. Tap the underlined tag, then tap “Convert to tag.”

Do any of the following:
Below Tags at the bottom of the screen, touch and hold a tag, then tap Rename Tag or Delete Tag.
Tap Edit (at the top of the folders list), scroll down to the tags, then tap a tag to rename it or tap .
When you delete a tag, it’s also removed from all Smart Folders that use it.

View all notes with tags: Tap All Tags.
View notes with specific tags: Tap one or more tags; to exclude a tag, tap the tag until the name has a line through it. Then choose to view notes matching any or all of the selected tags.
