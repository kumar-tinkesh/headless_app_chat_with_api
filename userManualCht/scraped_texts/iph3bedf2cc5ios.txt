Share location of a lost item in Find My on iPhone
In the Find My app on your iPhone, you can create a temporary webpage to share the location of a lost AirTag or other item. For example, you can share the webpage with an airline to help them track your mishandled bag.
If you want to share an item with a contact, see Share an AirTag .
Note: You can’t share the location of an item if it’s within proximity of the device sharing your location. Finding items and sharing item location aren't available in all countries or regions.

Go to the Find My app on your iPhone.
Tap Items, tap the item that you want to share location updates for, then tap Share Item Location.
