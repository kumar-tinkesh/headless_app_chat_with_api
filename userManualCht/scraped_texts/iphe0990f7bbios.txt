Get live captions of spoken audio on iPhone
With Live Captions on iPhone, you can get a real-time transcription of spoken audio. Use Live Captions to more easily follow the audio in any app, such as FaceTime or Podcasts, as well as live conversations around you.
Note: Live Captions is available on iPhone 11 and later when the primary language is set to English (U.S.) or English (Canada). The accuracy of Live Captions may vary and shouldn’t be relied upon in high-risk or emergency situations.
Set up and customize Live Captions
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Live Captions, then turn on Live Captions.
Tap Appearance to customize the text, size, and color of the captions.
By default, Live Captions are shown across all apps. To get live captions only for certain apps such as FaceTime or RTT, turn them on below In-App Live Captions.
