Record videos in Cinematic mode with your iPhone camera
Cinematic mode applies a depth-of-field effect that keeps the subject of your video sharp while creating a beautifully blurred foreground and background. iPhone automatically identifies the subject of the video and keeps it in focus throughout the recording; if a new subject is identified, iPhone automatically transitions the point of focus. You can also manually adjust the point of focus while you record, or change it later in the Photos app.
Cinematic mode is available on supported models .

Select Cinematic mode , then do any of the following before you record:
Tap , then drag the slider left or right to adjust the depth-of-field effect.
