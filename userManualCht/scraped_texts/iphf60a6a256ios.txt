Control how Apple delivers advertising to you on iPhone
You control how Apple delivers advertising.
Ads delivered by Apple may appear in the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. These ads don’t access data from any other apps. In the App Store and Apple News, your search and download history may be used to serve you relevant search ads. In Apple News and Stocks, ads are served based partly on what you read or follow. This includes publishers you’ve enabled notifications for and the type of publishing subscription you have. The articles you read are not used to serve targeted ads to you outside these apps, and information collected about what you read is linked to a random identifier rather than to your Apple Account.
Review the information Apple uses to deliver ads
Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > View Ad Targeting Information.

Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising, then turn Personalized Ads on or off.
Note: Turning off personalized ads limits Apple’s ability to deliver relevant ads to you. It may not reduce the number of ads you receive.
