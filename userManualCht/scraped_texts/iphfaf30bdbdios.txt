Tell Siri about yourself on iPhone
You can provide information to Siri—including things like your home and work addresses, and your relationships—for a more personalized experience so you can say things like “Give me driving directions home” and “FaceTime mom.”
Tell Siri who you are
Open Contacts , then fill out your contact information .
Go to Settings > Siri > My Information, then tap your name.
Tell Siri how to say your name
Open Contacts , then tap your contact card.
Tap Edit, scroll down and tap “add field,” select a pronunciation name field, then type how to say your name.
You can also add a pronunciation for any other contact card in Contacts. See Edit contacts .
Tell Siri about a relationship
Say something like “Hey Siri, Eliza Block is my wife” or “Hey Siri, Ashley Kamin is my mom.”
Keep what Siri knows about you up to date on your Apple devices
On each device, go to Settings , then sign in to the same Apple Account .
If you use iCloud, your Siri settings stay up to date across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption.
If you don’t want Siri personalization to stay up to date across iPhone and your other devices, you can turn off Siri in iCloud settings.
Go to Settings > [ your name ] > iCloud.
Tap See All, then turn off Siri.
Note: If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you make a request is also sent to Apple to help Siri improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. To deliver relevant responses, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region. See Control the location information you share .
