Set up iCloud Drive on iPhone
You can access iCloud Drive and store files, create folders, and share documents with friends and family. You can access your content from all your devices where you’re signed in to the same Apple Account —including on a Mac, where iCloud Drive is located in the Finder.
iCloud Drive is built into the Files app on devices with iOS 11, iPadOS 13, or later. You can also use iCloud Drive on Mac computers (OS X 10.10 or later), Windows devices (iCloud for Windows 7 or later), or online at iCloud.com . Storage limits depend on your iCloud storage plan.
