Learn how to use Siri
CarPlay works with select third-party apps that you download to your iPhone. Compatible apps—including audio, navigation, messaging, and voice-calling apps, and apps made by your vehicle manufacturer—show up automatically on CarPlay Home and can be controlled with Siri. For example, you can use Siri to give you directions from your favorite navigation app. CarPlay also works with additional third-party apps for EV charging, parking, and quick food ordering.
Note: Compatible third-party navigation apps appear on CarPlay Dashboard while in use. When you’re not actively navigating, or if you’re navigating using more than one app, CarPlay Dashboard displays the last compatible navigation app that was used.
