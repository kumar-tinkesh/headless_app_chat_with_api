Play music with CarPlay
Use Siri or open Music in CarPlay to play music that’s available on your iPhone—including songs, artists, albums, playlists, and Radio.
Siri: Say something like:
“Let’s hear the Acoustic playlist”
“Play ‘You Need to Calm Down’ by Taylor Swift”
“Play more songs like this one”
“Play the rest of this album”
“Skip this song”
“Repeat this song”
“Shuffle this playlist”
“Tune into ESPN Radio”
Learn how to use Siri
If Siri doesn’t find what you asked for, be more specific. For example, say “Play the radio station ‘Pure Pop’” rather than saying “Play ‘Pure Pop.’”
You can also use the controls on your vehicle’s steering wheel, buttons on the Now Playing screen, and CarPlay Dashboard to control music playback.
You can also play music together using SharePlay. See Play music together in the car using SharePlay and CarPlay on iPhone .
Note: If you’re viewing CarPlay Dashboard, tap to see pages of all of your CarPlay apps, including Music.
