Use Shortcuts to automate tasks on iPhone
The Shortcuts app lets you automate tasks you do often with just a tap or by asking Siri. Create shortcuts to get directions to the next event in your Calendar, move text from one app to another, and more. Choose ready-made shortcuts from the Gallery or build your own using different apps to run multiple steps in a task.
