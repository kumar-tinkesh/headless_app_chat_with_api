Set up call forwarding on iPhone
You can set up call forwarding on iPhone if you have cellular service through a GSM network.
If you have cellular service through a CDMA network, contact your carrier for information about setting up call forwarding.
Go to Settings > Apps > Phone.
Tap Call Forwarding, then turn on Call Forwarding.
The Call Forwarding icon appears in the status bar when call forwarding is on.
On models with Dual SIM , choose a line.
Tap Forward To, enter the number you want to redirect to, then tap Back.
You must be in range of the cellular network when you set iPhone to forward calls, or calls won’t be forwarded.
If your carrier supports conditional call forwarding when the line is busy or not in service, contact them for setup information.
