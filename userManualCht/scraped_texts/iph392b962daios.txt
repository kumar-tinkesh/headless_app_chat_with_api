Sync a third-party workout app to Fitness on iPhone
You can sync a compatible third-party workout app to the Fitness app on iPhone to help you meet your fitness goals. Fitness suggests workout apps that you can download from the App Store.
Go to the Fitness app on your iPhone.
Tap the Activity rings, then scroll down to Add To Your Rings.
Choose an app, then download it from the App Store.
Open the app and if prompted, grant permission to share data with the Health app.
Any workout you complete in a compatible third-party app appears in your activity summary and contributes to the progress toward closing your Move ring in the Fitness app.
To find out if a workout app youâ€™ve downloaded is compatible with the Fitness and Health apps, see the Apple Support article Manage Health data on your iPhone or Apple Watch .
