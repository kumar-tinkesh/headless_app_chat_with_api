Monitor your walking steadiness in Health on iPhone
When you carry your iPhone in a pocket or holster near your waist, the Health app uses custom algorithms that assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can receive a notification if your steadiness becomes low or stays low, and you can automatically share the notification with someone close to you. Health can also show you exercises to help improve your walking steadiness. (iPhone 8 or later.)
