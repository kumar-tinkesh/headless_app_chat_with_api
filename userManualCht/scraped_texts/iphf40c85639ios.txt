Listen to news stories with CarPlay
Use CarPlay to listen to Apple News Today audio briefings and, if you’re an Apple News+ subscriber, audio versions of select news stories. (If you aren’t a subscriber, you can listen to story previews.)
You can use your vehicles’s built-in controls to open News and select a story to play.
Note: If you’re viewing CarPlay Dashboard and News doesn’t appear in the recent apps list on the left, tap to see pages of all of your CarPlay apps, including News.
You can also use the controls on your vehicle’s steering wheel, the buttons on the Now Playing screen, and CarPlay Dashboard to control playback.
