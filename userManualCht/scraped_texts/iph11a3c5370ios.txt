Control your home from CarPlay
You can use suggestions from Siri that appear on CarPlay Dashboard or use Siri directly to control HomeKit-enabled accessories, such as garage doors, lights, and door locks.
Siri: Say something like:
“Open the garage door”
“Did I leave the garage door open?”
“Close the garage door”
“Lock the front door”
“Turn on the lights”
“Turn off the lights”
