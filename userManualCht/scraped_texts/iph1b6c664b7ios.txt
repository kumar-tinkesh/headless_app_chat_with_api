Use NameDrop on iPhone to share your contact info
You can use NameDrop to quickly share new contact information with a nearby iPhone or Apple Watch (Apple Watch Ultra, Apple Watch Series 7 and later, and Apple Watch SE 2nd generation).
Note: NameDrop only works for sending new contact information, not updating an existing contact.
Use NameDrop on iPhone
Hold the display of your iPhone a few centimeters from the top of the other person’s iPhone or Apple Watch.
Continue holding your devices near each other until NameDrop appears on both screens.
Choose to share your contact card and receive the other person’s, or to only receive the other person’s.
If you’re sharing your contact card, tap , select the fields you want to include, then tap Save. The same fields will be selected by default next the time you use NameDrop.
To cancel, move the two devices away from each other or lock your iPhone before the NameDrop transfer completes.
Turn off NameDrop on iPhone
NameDrop is on by default. To turn off NameDrop (and other Bring Devices Together features), go to Settings > General > AirDrop, then turn off Bring Devices Together.
