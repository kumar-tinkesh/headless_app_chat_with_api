Share an AirTag or other item in Find My on iPhone
If you want to share an item that’s paired with an AirTag (or a third-party item that works with Find My), you can share it in Find My so the borrower can see it on a map and find it . If it’s nearby, Find My can play a sound , and if you’re using a supported iPhone , you can find its precise location . People you’re sharing items with don’t receive tracking notifications when the items are moving with them.
You can share an AirTag or other item with up to five borrowers in addition to yourself, for a total of six users per item, as long as the following requirements are met:
Two-factor authentication must be turned on for your Apple Account.
The person you share with must have an Apple Account and be signed in to it. They must also use iCloud. You can’t share with a child account .
The owner and borrowers must have iCloud Keychain turned on.
The owner and borrowers must be using iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14, or later.
Note: You share a third-party item the same way you share an AirTag. Location sharing and finding devices aren’t available in all countries or regions.
Share an AirTag
Go to the Find My app on your iPhone.
Tap Items, tap the name of the AirTag or item you want to share, then tap Add Person below Share This AirTag (or Share This Item).

A list of everyone you invited appears on the item’s main screen, along with the status of their invitations.
When someone accepts an invitation, the shared AirTag appears in Find My below Items and the recipient is notified that an item is being shared with them. If someone declines the invitation, their name is removed from the list, and you no longer see it.
Ask the owner of an AirTag to share it in Find My
If the owner of an AirTag shares it with you but doesn’t do so in Find My, you’ll receive an unknown AirTag notification and tracking notifications. To stop receiving tracking notifications for the AirTag, ask the owner to share it with you in Find My.
Note: You can only ask an owner to share an AirTag if you’re in the same Family Sharing group. See Add a member to a Family Sharing group .
In the tracking notification you receive, tap Ask Owner to Share AirTag.
Tap Ask Owner.
If the owner wants to add you as a borrower, you receive an invitation to share the AirTag.
