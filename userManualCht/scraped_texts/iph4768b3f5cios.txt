Hear audio descriptions for video content on iPhone
If you can’t see your screen and your content includes audio descriptions, you can listen to an audio description—a separate audio track that narrates or describes the visual content of a clip, show, or movie.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio Descriptions.
Turn on Audio Descriptions.
If you don’t see audio descriptions, see the Apple Support article Turn on audio descriptions on your iPhone or iPad .
If you’re a content creator and want to add audio descriptions to a file, see Add descriptive audio tracks in the Compressor User Guide.
