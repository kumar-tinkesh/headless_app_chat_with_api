Use Advanced Data Protection for your iCloud data
By default, iCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit, storing it in an encrypted format, and securing your encryption keys in Apple data centers. In addition, many Apple services use end-to-end encryption; your information is encrypted using keys derived from your devices and your device passcode, which only you know.
For the highest level of cloud data security, you can turn on Advanced Data Protection (iOS 16.2 or later required). It uses end-to-end encryption on more data categories such as the following:
Device backup
Messages backup
iCloud Drive
Notes
Photos
Reminders
Safari bookmarks
Siri Shortcuts
Voice Memos
Wallet passes
With Advanced Data Protection, your protected data can be decrypted only on your trusted devices, protecting your information even in the case of a data breach in the cloud. Not even Apple can access your information.
For detailed information about the requirements for using Advanced Data Protection, see the Apple Support article How to turn on Advanced Data Protection for iCloud .
Turn on Advanced Data Protection
Go to Settings > [ your name ] > iCloud, then tap Advanced Data Protection.
Tap Turn On Advanced Data Protection.
If you haven’t set up a Recovery Contact or Recovery Key, tap Account Recovery, tap Set Up Account Recovery, then follow the onscreen instructions.
WARNING: If you use Advanced Data Protection, you’re responsible for your data recovery. Because Apple won’t have the keys required to recover your data, you’ll need to have a Recovery Contact or Recovery Key set up on your account. You can use these additional recovery methods to regain access to your data if you ever forget your password or lose access to your account.
If you choose to turn off Advanced Data Protection later, your iCloud data will revert to the standard level of security.
