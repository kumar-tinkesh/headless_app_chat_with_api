Listen to subscriber-only content in Podcasts on iPhone
In the Podcasts app, you can listen to audio content from Apple Music, Apple News+, and eligible third-party subscription apps.
Note: Not all apps offer audio content thatâ€™s available in Podcasts.
Connect app subscriptions to Podcasts
Your eligible app subscriptions are automatically connected to Podcasts if you subscribed through the App Store and the app offers audio content in Podcasts.
If you subscribed using another method, do the following:
Go to the Podcasts app on your iPhone.
Browse or search for a channel with an eligible subscription.
On the Channel page, tap the Already a Subscriber link, then follow the instructions to connect your app subscription.
After an app subscription is connected, you can find the channel in your library. You can use Podcasts to play all subscriber-only shows and episodes.
