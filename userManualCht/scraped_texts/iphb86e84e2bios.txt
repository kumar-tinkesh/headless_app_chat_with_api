The Freeform app gives you a boundless canvas for creativity. Bring everything together, including photos, drawings, links, and files. And invite others to work with you.
Gather ideas freely

Collaborate with others
Tap to invite people to start working together in real time on a board. You can add sticky notes to conduct a brainstorming session or provide feedback.

Start on your iPhone, keep working on your iPad or Mac
The Freeform boards you store in iCloud—and any changes you make to them—stay up to date on all your Apple devices when you’re signed in to the same Apple Account. To use iCloud with Freeform, go to Settings > [ your name ] > iCloud > See All (in the Saved to iCloud section), then turn on Freeform.
