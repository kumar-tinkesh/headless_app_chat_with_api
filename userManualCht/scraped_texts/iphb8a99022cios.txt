iPhone User Guide
Report traffic incidents in Maps on iPhone
You can report accidents, hazards, speed checks, and road work, and you can report when they’re cleared. (Features vary by region and country.)
Apple evaluates incoming incident reports. When there’s a high level of confidence in the reports, incident markers—such as for hazards and accidents —are displayed (or cleared) for other Maps users too.
Note: Speed checks, where supported, aren’t displayed with incident markers. Instead, notifications for speed checks appear when you follow turn-by-turn driving directions .
Report traffic incidents

“Report an accident”
