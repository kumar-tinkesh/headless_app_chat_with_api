Choose an alternative layout for Magic Keyboard with iPhone
With an alternative keyboard layout, you can enter letters and marks that are different from the ones on Magic Keyboard. For example, with the ABC - Extended keyboard layout, you can type letters and enter diacritical marks for several different European languages and tone marks for Mandarin Chinese in Pinyin.
Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard.
Tap a language at the top of the screen, then choose an alternative layout from the list.
