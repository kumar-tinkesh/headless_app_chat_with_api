Control your home remotely with iPhone
In the Home app , you can control your accessories even when you’re away from home. To do so, you need a home hub—a device such as Apple TV (4th generation or later) or HomePod.
Go to Settings > [ your name ] > iCloud, tap See All, then turn on Home.
You must be signed in to the same Apple Account on your home hub device and your iPhone.
If you have an Apple TV or HomePod, and you’re signed in to the same Apple Account as your iPhone, it’s set up automatically as a home hub.
