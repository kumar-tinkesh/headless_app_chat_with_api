Adjust the accessibility settings for AirPods on iPhone
With AirPods 3 or later, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max, you can adjust the accessibility settings to suit your mobility or hearing needs.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > AirPods.
If you have multiple AirPods, select one.
Set any of the following options:
Press Speed: Adjust how quickly you must press two or three times before an action occurs.
Press and Hold Duration: Adjust the duration required to press and hold on your AirPods.
Noise Cancellation with One AirPod: With AirPods Pro, turn on noise cancellation even when you’re using only one of your AirPods.
Spatial Audio Head Tracking: When you turn on Follow iPhone, Spatial Audio sounds like it’s coming from your iPhone instead of following the movement of your head (for supported audio and video content).
Tone Volume: Adjust the volume of the sound effects that are played by your AirPods, such as low battery alerts.
If you have AirPods Pro 2, you can use your iPhone to take a hearing test. If you have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, you can get hearing assistance with the Hearing Aid feature. See Use hearing health features with AirPods Pro 2 .
