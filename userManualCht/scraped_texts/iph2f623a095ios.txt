Use accessibility features during iPhone setup
iPhone has accessibility features that you can turn on the first time you turn on your iPhone, to make it easier to set up and personalize other iPhone features.
Hear what’s onscreen with VoiceOver
VoiceOver—a gesture-based screen reader—tells you what’s happening onscreen.
After iPhone is turned on, triple-click the side button (on an iPhone with Face ID) or triple-click the Home button (on other iPhone models) to turn on VoiceOver .
Do any of the following and more:
Speak the entire screen: Swipe up with two fingers.
Find out what you’re touching: Touch the screen or drag your finger over it. VoiceOver speaks the name of the item your finger is on, including icons and text. Swipe right to elect the next item. Tap with four fingers near the top to select the first item on the screen.
Select an item: Tap to select a button or link, and activate it by double-tapping.
Scroll to another page: Swipe with three fingers.
Open the onscreen rotor: Turn two fingers on the screen, as if rotating a dial. See Control VoiceOver using the rotor .
Note: When VoiceOver is on, basic gestures don’t work as usual. See Use VoiceOver gestures and Operate iPhone when VoiceOver is on .
You can adjust audio options, language, voice, speaking rate, how much detail VoiceOver provides, and more in VoiceOver settings .

Double-tap the screen with three fingers, then use the slider to set a magnification level.
Use three fingers to scroll around the zoomed-in screen.
