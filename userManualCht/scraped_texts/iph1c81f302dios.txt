Share long videos on iPhone
Some long video files are too large to send in a standard text message. You can use AirDrop, iCloud, or Mail Drop to send long videos that you record with your iPhone camera.

On iPhone or iPad: Go to Settings > General > AirDrop, then tap Everyone for 10 Minutes.
On a Mac: Choose Apple menu > System Settings, then click General in the sidebar. Click AirDrop & Handoff, then click the pop-up menu next to AirDrop and choose Everyone.
Go to the Photos app on your iPhone.
Tap the video you want to send, then tap .
If you want to send the video in its original format, including metadata, location, and any associated edit history or captions, tap Options, then turn on All Photos Data.
