Adjust the onscreen and external keyboard settings for accessibility on iPhone
You can set the onscreen keyboard on iPhone to show only uppercase letters, and if you use a physical keyboard with your iPhone, adjust key sensitivity and make it easier to press combinations of keys.
You can also set typing options , such as auto-correction and slide to type, make it easier to type with one hand , and add keyboards for other languages or alternative layouts.
Set the onscreen keyboard to display only uppercase letters
If it’s easier to read uppercase letters, you can set an option so the onscreen keyboard doesn’t display lowercase letters.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards, then turn off Show Lowercase Keys.
Tip: Rotate iPhone to landscape orientation to use a larger keyboard for typing in many apps, including Mail, Messages, Notes, and Safari. See Change or lock the screen orientation .
Change how the keys respond on an external keyboard
If you use Magic Keyboard or another physical keyboard with iPhone, you can adjust the sensitivity of keys and make it easier to press combinations of keys.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards, then tap any of the following:
Key Repeat: You can set how long you must press and hold a key before it starts repeating and how fast it repeats once it starts. You can also prevent the key from repeating at all.
Sticky Keys: When you need to press multiple keys at the same time, you can press each key separately instead. For example, enter the keyboard shortcut Command-Z by pressing Command, then pressing Z.
Slow Keys: Adjust the time between when you press a key and when it’s activated.
