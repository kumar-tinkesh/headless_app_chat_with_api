Use VoiceOver on iPhone with an Apple external keyboard
If you use Magic Keyboard with iPhone, you can use keyboard shortcuts to activate VoiceOver commands.
Additionally, you can use VoiceOver Help to learn the keyboard layout and the actions associated with various key combinations. VoiceOver Help speaks keys and keyboard commands as you type them, without performing the associated action.
Choose the VoiceOver modifier
The modifier is a key or set of keys you press with one or more other keys to enter VoiceOver commands. You can set the modifier to be the Caps Lock key or the Control and Option keys pressed at the same time.
Go to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Typing > Modifier Keys.
Choose the modifier for VoiceOver commands: the Caps Lock key or the Control and Option keys.
This modifier is abbreviated as “VO” below.
