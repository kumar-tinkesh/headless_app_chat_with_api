Configure a router in Home on iPhone
You can use the Home app to make your smart home more secure by allowing a compatible router to control which services your HomeKit accessories can communicate with on your home Wi-Fi network and on the internet. HomeKit-enabled routers require that you have an Apple TV or HomePod set up as a home hub. See the Home Accessories website for a list of compatible routers.
Configure your router’s settings
Go to the Home app on your iPhone.
Set up the router with the manufacturer’s app on an iPhone or iPad.
On the Home tab, tap , then tap Home Settings.
Tap Wi-Fi Network & Routers.
Turn on HomeKit Accessory Security, tap an accessory, then choose one of these settings:
Restrict to Home: The router only allows the accessory to connect to your home hub.
This option may prevent firmware updates or other services.
Automatic: The router allows the accessory to connect to an automatically updated list of manufacturer-approved internet services and local devices.
No Restriction: The router allows the accessory to connect to any internet service or local device.
This provides the lowest level of security.
