Search in Messages on iPhone
You can search for text messages and attachments, using different criteria to narrow your results.
Go to the Messages app on your iPhone.
Tap the search field above the conversation list. (You may need to swipe down to reveal the search field.)
Enter what you’re looking for (such as a word or phrase).
When you enter a search term—such as Photo, Link, Wallet (for passes), or the name of a conversation or person—a filter appears below the search field. Tap it to add it to the search as a filter.
Tip: To limit your search to one person or conversation, start by typing a person’s name, tap “Messages with” or “Messages in,” then tap other criteria that appear or add any text you want to find in your conversation.
To combine search criteria, add another search term or filter.
Tap search, then tap a message in the results list to read it.
The search field also opens suggestions—such as conversations, photos, locations, links, and more. Tap any suggestion to quickly jump to a conversation.
