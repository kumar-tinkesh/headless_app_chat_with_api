Measure dimensions with iPhone
You can use your iPhone camera to measure nearby objectsâ€”automatically detect the dimensions of rectangular objects or manually set the start and end points of a measurement.
For best results, use Measure on well-defined objects located 0.5 to 3 meters (2 to 10 feet) from iPhone. (Measurements are approximate.)
Note: You can use Measure on external displays without turning on Screen Mirroring in Control Center.
Start a measurement
Go to the Measure app (in the Utilities folder) on your iPhone.
Use the iPhone camera to slowly scan nearby objects.
Position iPhone so that the object you want to measure appears on the screen.
Note: For your privacy, when you use Measure to take measurements, a green dot appears at the top of the screen to indicate your camera is in use.
Take an automatic rectangle measurement
Go to the Measure app (in the Utilities folder) on your iPhone.

Use Ruler view
