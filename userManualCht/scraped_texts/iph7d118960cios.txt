Add Siri Shortcuts on iPhone
Apps can offer shortcuts for things you do frequently. You can use Siri to initiate these shortcuts with just your voice.
Some apps have Siri Shortcuts set up automatically. You can also create your own.
Add a suggested shortcut
Tap Add to Siri when you see a suggestion for a shortcut, then follow the onscreen instructions to record a phrase of your choice that performs the shortcut.
You can also use the Shortcuts app to create a new shortcut that uses Siri, or to manage, re-record, and delete existing Siri Shortcuts. See the Shortcuts User Guide .
Use a shortcut
Activate Siri, then speak your phrase for the shortcut. See Use Siri .
Based on your routines and how you use your apps, Siri also suggests shortcuts on the Home Screen, the Lock Screen, and when you start a search. To turn off shortcut suggestions for an app, see Change Siri settings on iPhone .
