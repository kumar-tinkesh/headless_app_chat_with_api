Stay focused while driving with iPhone
Turning on the Driving Focus helps you stay focused on the road. When you turn it on, text messages and other notifications are silenced or limited. You can have Siri read replies to you so you don’t have to look at your iPhone. Incoming calls are allowed only when iPhone is connected to CarPlay—a car Bluetooth® system—or a hands-free accessory.
WARNING: For important information about navigation and avoiding distractions that could lead to dangerous situations, see Important safety information for iPhone . The Driving Focus is not a substitute for following all the rules that prohibit distracted driving.
