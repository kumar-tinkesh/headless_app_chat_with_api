Add a Stocks widget to your Home Screen
Touch and hold the Home Screen until the apps begin to jiggle.
Tap at the top of the screen to open the widget gallery.
Swipe up to find Stocks, then tap it.
Swipe left and right to view the different widget types (Watchlist and Symbol) and sizes. When you see the option you want, tap Add Widget, then tap Done.
To move the widget on your Home Screen, touch and hold the Home Screen until the apps begin to jiggle. Drag the widget to a new location, then tap Done.
Change the widget display
After you add a Stocks widget to your Home Screen, you can change its appearance and the information it displays.
Touch and hold the Stocks widget on your Home Screen.
Tap Edit Widget.
Depending on the type of widget you chose, Watchlist or Symbol, you can make the following changes:
Change the widget symbol: Tap the current symbol, then tap the new symbol you want from the watchlist. Or use the search field to search for a new symbol.
Change the widget watchlist: Tap the name of the current watchlist, then tap the watchlist you want to display.
Change when news stories appear: Tap In Off Hours, then choose an option.
Show the watchlist name: Turn on Show Watchlist Name.
Show more symbols or additional symbol information: Turn on Show More Details.
Tip: You can add more than one Stocks widget to your Home Screen—and choose a different size for each—so you can quickly see updates for different symbols or watchlists.
Stocks widgets are also available for the iPhone Lock Screen. See Create a custom Lock Screen .
